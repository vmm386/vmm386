Introduction to the Project.
****************************

   The aim of the project was to write a small operating system for the
Intel 80386 processor capable of supporting multiple virtual 8086 PC's
using an inbuilt mode of the 80386. This involved writing a kernel and
the device drivers to control all of the hardware and also a filing
system and user interface. We also had to create an enviroment that
emulated the hardware of a standard PC.

   This project intrested me for several reasons. I have a strong
intrest in operating systems and operating systems technology and to
have the chance to write one was greatly welcomed. Secondly, I was
intrigued by the process of emulating a computer environment and wanted
to see what technical challenges would arise from such a project.
Because we were emulating a system already available, there was a
device interface that we had to conform to and it was quite intresting
to see how hardware could be emulatedby software.  And finally, I
wanted to gain an indepth knowledge of the architecture of the Intel
80x86 family of processors with respect to how they work and how they
are programmed.

My Contribution to the Project.

My Appraisal of the Project.
****************************

   My overall feeling about the project is that it was a success.
Although we did not accomplish the main task which was to allow full
virtualisation of the 80386's protected mode, I believe that we made
substantal progress towards this goal. I have definitely gained a
fuller understanding of the design and construction of operating
systems and of supporting virtualisation of another system. Although
this project could be expanded in many directions and taken further in
all of these, the task of developing and writing the core components
was accomplished. Obvisouly more time could be spent writing virtual and
physical device drivers given the range of hardware accessories
available and refining the current devices would also benefit the
overall system in terms of speed, efficiency and stability. Personally
I believe that we have written a small, clean and relatively bugfree
operating system and for a first attempt I am pleased with the result.

   The project group consisting of John, Chris and myself worked well
together.  Although we did impose deadlines at the start of the
project, these proved to be unrealistic as we came upon problems that
we hadnt encountered before.  The interaction between the individual
members of the group was also good and no one minded one person for
example debugging someone elses code or adding bits to it. We also had
an advantage because the project itself was exciting and we all showed
a great deal of enthusiam towards it. This resulted in large
programming sessions which might last several hours where all members
were working on the same piece of source code and the ideas generated
and problem solved by just all sitting around one computer with each
person adding parts as they saw fit. The design of the project also
meant that a co-operative effort could be made with the design of the
kernel whilst seperate parts in modules could be developed on one's
own. The running of the group was also done in a democratic way, and no
one tried to impose their ideas on everyone else.

Future Directions of the Project.
*********************************

   Given that the project is an operating system, there are many
directions in which it can be taken. A few of the ideas for expansion
of the system are outlined as follows:

Adding Virtual 32-bit Protected Mode Tasks.
===========================================

   This was the original aim of the project and if completed would
allow almost any operating system for the PC to be run under our
operating system. This is a very complicated addition but having the
core system already completed would mean that only the parts concerned
with emultaing the behaviour of the Intel 80386 in this mode have to be
written. Also the emulation of the hardware is independant to the
operating mode of the processor so the virtual devices that have
already been written can be reused without any changes.

Handling Of The Floating Point Unit (FPU).
==========================================

   Currently, no attempt is made to save or restore the state of this
processor in anyway. This has serious implications because if more than
one process (either part of the operating system itself or a virtual
machine) attempted to use the FPU, erorrs could occur and the operating
system itself could stop working.

Emulation Of A Floating Point Unit.
===================================

   This is in addition to the above idea and would require a module
designed to emulate all of the functions of a FPU.  The 80386 processor
has support for allowing a FPU emulation unit to exist and although
this would be a large project to undertake, it would give any machine
running the operating system virtual machines with a complete CPU/FPU
pair regardless of wether an FPU was installed in the actual machine.

Adding virtual memory.
======================

   Currently the operating system does not support using a disk unit to
provide extra memory to the system. Because each machine could use upto
one megabyte of memory in its simplest configuration, this would be a
useful feature.  Having used a paged memory architecture to implement
the memory subsystem should mean that the addition of such a feature
would not be too difficult to implement.

Adding Native Tasks.
====================

   All processes running at the moment currently reside in the kernel's
memory address space and this means that processes can interfere with
each others data and code areas. Having native tasks would allow
protection between tasks and could even mean that the development
environment could be moved from Linux to VMM/386.

A Virtual File System (VFS).
============================

   Currently all access to the files on a disk unit go via VMM/386's
native filesystem. Unfortuantley this means that it is almost
impossible to use disks with other file systems. Adding a VFS layer
would mean that modules could be written for other filing systems such
as MS-DOS's FAT and OS/2's HPFS systems. This would give VMM/386 better
interoperability with other operating systems residing on the same disk
unit.

A Virtual Network.
==================

   This is an ambitious addition to the project but one that would be
of great use. It would require the construction of a virtual device to
emulate a network card for each virtual machine and a process to act as
a network between these virtual network cards. This would add two
useful abilities to the project:

   * The ability to allow virtual machines to communicate to each other
     via a common networking protocol for example TCP/IP.

   * The ability to share disks. This is an important function because
     currently if more than one task has access to the same hard disk
     and they are both using the same partition then corruption of the
     data can occur on that disk because each virtual machine assumes
     it has total control over that disks and would not be taking
     account of changes made by the other machines. This is especially
     true if the virtual machines are buffering data or if two machines
     both make changes to the data at the same time. By using a virtual
     network, only one machine need be given access to the hard disk.
     This virtual machine could then run a network server program and
     all the other virtual machines could run network client software
     so only one virtual machine actually had `physical' access to the
     hard disk.

Writing A DOS Extender
======================

   Adding a module to act as a DOS Extender would be a useful facility.
Although only of use to virtual machines running the MS-DOS operating
system, it would enable 32-bit DOS programs to run. It would also be a
good start to finally adding full 80386 Protected Mode virtualisation.
My providing either VCPI (Virtual Control Program Interface) or DPMI
(Dos Protected Mode Interface) calls it could also allow an operating
systems writer to implement a protected mode operating system using
calls to this module to emulate some of the 80386's privileged
instruction. It would allow the writer to use VMM/386 as a testbed
environment for developing an operating system with only minimal
changes being required when finally making the operating system run on
its own.
