The @code{vfloppy} Virtual Device driver provides BIOS level support
for a single floppy drive in a virtual machine.

The virtualisation presently allows for the user to start a
machine with a floppy drive mapped to a specified file. All access
to that file will be converted to references into that file, the
file normally being the image of a physical disk.

Use the @code{vmvxd} command (@pxref{Launching VMs}) to install the
@code{vfloppy} virtual device into the current virtual machine
context. The command format is:

@example
vmvxd vfloppy [@var{file}]
@end example

It opens the file @var{file} and all access in the virtual
machine, via the BIOS, to the floppy drive will be mirrored in the
specified file.

If @var{file} isn't specified, the device will be added to the
virtual machine, but it won't open any file. The file can later
be specified with the @code{vdisk} command.

@deffn {Command} vdisk pid [file]
The @code{vdisk} command specifies the file to which all floppy
disk access in the virtual machine @var{pid} will be mirrored into.

If no @var{file} is specified, then any currently open file is
closed. If a file was already open, then it is closed prior
to opening of the specified file.
@end deffn
