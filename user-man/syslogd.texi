The system log daemon allows processes to send status and debugging output
to a common file. The operation of the log daemon process can be controlled
by the user to set how much information goes to the file or can completely
stop all output to the logfile.

@deffn {Command} syslog command
This command controls operation of the system log daemon. The
@var{command} parameter defines the operation performed, it can be one
of the following:

@table @code
@item -stop
Prevents any output going to the logfile.

@item -start
Allows output to go to the logfile.

@item -level @var{new-level}
This sets the logging level. Only processes which have a 
logging level less than or equal to @var{new-level} will have output
present in the logfile.

@item -status
Prints information regarding the current status of the log daemon.
@end table
@end deffn
