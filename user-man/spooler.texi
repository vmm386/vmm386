The printer spooler allows sharing of a single printer device by more than
one process. The user can submit files to be printed along with files printed
by other processes and access to the printer by virtual machines.

The spooler defines the following commands.

@deffn {Command} lpr files@dots{}
This command adds the listed files to the printer spooler queue.

It makes a copy of the file in the spooler directory and adds it
to the spooler queue. It then reports the result of each file it
attempts to spool.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} lpq
This command lists all the files currently in the spool queue with a job number
for each file spooled. This number can be used in conjunction with the
@code{lprm} command.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} lprm job-numbers@dots{}
This command removes the files from the printer spooler queue with the
job numbers listed in the commands parameters before they are printed.
It reports if the job was successfully dequeued or not.

The job numbers can be obtained from the @code{lpq} command.
@end deffn
