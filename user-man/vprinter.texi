The @code{vprinter} virtual device creates virtual printer ports for a
virtual machine. This allows printing from the virtual machine via the
printer spooler.

Use the @code{vmvxd} command to add a virtual printer device to the
virtual machine being initialised (@pxref{Launching VMs}). The command
format is:

@example
vmvxd vprinter @var{addr}@dots{}
@end example

Each @var{addr} parameter (there may be up to four in all) specifies
the base address of one printer port in hexadecimal notation. This
allows each virtual machine to have up to four printer ports. The
standard printer port address are @code{278}, @code{378} and
@code{3BC}.
