The ramdisk is a simple means of utilising memory in a way accessible
through the filing system.

Once a suitable region of memory has been allocated for the purpose,
a device becomes available for file storage, and any accesses to
that device are reflected into the allocated memory. The devices 
are numbered @samp{rd0} onwards, the numeric part representing the
number of the device.

Once the ramdisk device driver is loaded, management of the
ramdisks is achieved with the commands listed below.

@deffn {Command} rdinfo
This command lists information on the allocated ramdisks present
in the system, including their device name, the address of their
memory regions and the size of the region.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} addrd blocks
This enables the user to add a ramdisk to the system of @var{blocks}
blocks in size. A block is 512 bytes in size (unlike the file system,
where a block is in fact 1024 bytes in size) and memory will be
allocated for it, if possible. Once allocated, the area is initialised
and mounted ready for use. Numbering of the ramdisk is incremental from
the last created ramdisk, starting at zero.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} delrd device
Removes the device @var{device} from the system, making it unavailable
for use. Any information stored on it is lost. In removing it from
the driver, the device is unmounted and the memory it was using
is returned returned to the system.
@end deffn
