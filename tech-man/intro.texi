This technical manual describes in some detail the implementation of
our project, a simple operating system to provide multiple virtual
machines for a PC style computer. We have exercised our judgement in
deciding how detailed this description is. Our aim was that this manual
should present the reader with all the information they need to be able
to implement extensions to the system, whatever possible form these
extensions may be in (i.e. shell commands, new modules, etc@dots{}).

To achieve this aim our main preoccupation has been to describe the
@emph{interface} between the parts of the systems, normally this means
documenting the functions that each module exports. Obviously this is
no good without additional explanation of how each part of the system
actually works; hopefully we have found a good balance between
swamping the reader with unnecessary implementation details and telling
them what they need to know to program in the system.
