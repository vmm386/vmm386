The ramdisk driver is in fact a very simple block driver, which
represents a block of memory in a form usable by the filing system
@pxref{Filing System} module.

The ramdisk is designed to be able to mimic a floppy disk, and
as such works on an internal block size of 512 bytes, which is
mapped from the filing system's present block size of 1024 bytes.

@deftypefn {ramdisk Function} {rd_dev_t *} create_ramdisk (u_long @var{blocks})
This function is called to create a ramdisk device. In doing so,
the relevant amount of memory is allocated and the filing system is
instructed to prepare it as a file system, where it is subsequently
mounted ready for use.  As it stands, a 1.4meg ramdisk is
created at driver initialisation, also. Ramdisk devices are
labelled @samp{rd0} where 0 is the number of the ramdisk.
@end deftypefn

The other functions inside the Ramdisk module are fairly standard
Filing system and block device interface functions.
